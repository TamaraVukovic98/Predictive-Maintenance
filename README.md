## Dataset Overview

This dataset provides information about machine processes and their associated failure modes. Each entry includes detailed operational data and failure indicators.

### Features

- **UID**: Unique identifier ranging from 1 to 10,000.
- **Product ID**: Letter (L, M, or H) indicating product quality variant (Low, Medium, or High) and a serial number.
- **Type**: Product type (L, M, or H) from the Product ID column.
- **Air Temperature [K]**: Generated with a random walk process, normalized to a standard deviation of 2 K around 300 K.
- **Process Temperature [K]**: Generated with a random walk process, normalized to a standard deviation of 1 K, added to the air temperature plus 10 K.
- **Rotational Speed [rpm]**: Calculated from a power of 2860 W with added normally distributed noise.
- **Torque [Nm]**: Normally distributed around 40 Nm with a standard deviation of 10 Nm.
- **Tool Wear [min]**: Quality variants H/M/L add 5/3/2 minutes of tool wear to the used tool.

### Binary Classification Problem

Using this dataset, we address a binary classification problem where the goal is to predict machine failure based on the provided features. We employ Logistic Regression and various techniques to handle imbalanced datasets, including:

- **Over-sampling**: Generating synthetic instances of the minority class.
- **Under-sampling**: Eliminating instances of the majority class.
- **SMOTE**: one of the most well-known algorithms for generating synthetic instances


This approach aims to build an effective model for predicting machine failure while addressing class imbalance.
